dataview is function programming language which looks like json.

we can write varibles and functions in header part too.

{}  - represnt object
[] - represent type array list.

var number=["one","two",3]   - this is variable number which represented array.

object is value key pair 
object can be in variable  like 
var object1 {one : 1 , two: 2 , }   --  object1
below ---  line
just mention number  -  it will give the output at preview tab.

when you want to construct a new object with existant object then use ().
ex: {(object1)}--you can always try how it work

++   -  for concatanation
+   - (adding) is add another element as object in array 

array + object -  possible   but array ++ object not possible.
reverse doesnt work   -   object + array  and object ++ array

object 1 + object2 -  not possible
object1 ++ object 2 -  isn possible.

-  -> substraction 
example = object 1 ++ object2 - "two"    :  we canuse many ways this expression  as (object1 ++ object2 -  two)  and many more 
when we use '-' then mention key with value got removed. means only key need to match but when we use "--" , both key/value needs to be match.
for "--"  - above not work 
to work  we have to mention = object 1 ++ object2 -- "two: 2"

====================================================
combine 2 arrays  , means if you want array of arrays then use zip  means we have arrays equal to value matched in array.
countries zip capitals
also we can do it as , zip(countries,capitals)

flatten - is a function which make multiple array into 1 array 
flatten(zip(countries,capitals))
unzip(zip(countries,capitals))  - it will reverse of zip....it will have 2 arrays inside 1 but as seperated.

===================================

{} product.json  - how we create this in main/resource  ==  it is input metadata which we used for transform module.
means i know we create it in our own system and then select that,,but i saqw one video where it was already present in one project main/resource
then they copied to other project where we wanted it and name was like that.

where we use set variables in dataview - that we created un transform
do we have to call those independent varible in our payload expression ????  and how we do it -  i guess var.name

write a attribute to xml - is nothing but mentioning the value at same level as root value.
ex :  product @(pid: payload.productid) :{}

when we want some computation or change in data then we can use function - we can define this function in header part with 2 arguments
fun getofferprice(price , discountpercentage)= price*(100-dicountpercentage)/100.

datawieve is functional programming lang so we can actually create a variable pointing to function also -  in the header
so how to define function as variable -  var vgetofferprice = (price , discountpercentage) -> price*(100-dicountpercentage)/100.

->  this sign is for we are calling or using function which have no name for variable.

how to call those function and variable in main body means in payload -
offerprice: getofferprice(payload.originalprice,payload.offer.discountpercentage)    - herewe have payload.offer because it is nested field.
offerprice: vgetofferprice(payload.originalprice,payload.offer.discountpercentage)

we created var  - is the dataview varibles  but we created set variable - they are not datview variable they are mule event variable.

************************************
one major doubt -  when we post the data , http listner - we transform the data in form we want
so the transformed data get posted right ----------
**************************************

============================================================================

how to create reuseable custome module in dataview - we can cretaed custome module by coping our functions or variable in it
for thisw eneed to create folder in resources thyen inside that create new file.dwl and copy function and variable in that file.

so how can we used this in our body as by importing
ex : import * from mymodules::customemodules  , if we remove the * then we have to modulename::
offerprice: customemodules::getofferprice(payload.originalprice,payload.offer.discountpercentage)  but if we are using * from then no need to do that.

we can also use alias namimg for function/variables 
ex : import fetofferprice as gop from mymodules::customemodules
offerprice: gop(payload.originalprice,payload.offer.discountpercentage)


import :: core  -  is bydefault present
others we have to mention so we can use the function which are present in those modules - like
import::core::Strings

then in body write like = String::camelize(payload.name)

**************
we can able to pass one function as argument to another function in dataview - --- it sis there on statinng   but need more real time example
ex = fun formatdata(myinput, formatter) = formatter(myinput)
----
formatdata("rajeshtoraskar",lower)
"rajeshtoraskar" formatdata lower

we can also pass type in function arguments
fun formatdata(myinput:String, formatter : ()String) -> string) = formatter(myinput)

***************

how to chain function - [1,2,3,4,5] filter $>2 ordered by $  -  it will give [3,4,5]
[1,2,3,4,5] filter $>2   -  it will give [3,4,5]

to chain function we need to have function which have 2 arguments , if function have 1 argumenmt we cant chain that.
we cannot write rajeshtoraskar lower ..... so make this possible we will create our own custome function and then used it
ex - fun chain(myinpit , myfunction) = myfunction(myinput)
---
"rajeshtoraskar" chain lower  -  it will work

now use the same as above to anynomous function - 
{"one" : 1 . "two" : 2} chain (x) -> x.one ++ "" ++ x.two  -  it will work
upper({"one" : 1 . "two" : 2} chain (x) -> x.one ++ "" ++ x.two) it is same as below 
{"one" : 1 . "two" : 2} chain (x) -> x.one ++ "" ++ x.two chain upper

above is also similar to = 
Chain ( chain({"one" : 1 . "two" : 2}, (x) -> x.one ++ "" ++ x.two), upper)

******************************
major doubt --  then upper(lower(Rajesh)  it is not chanin function  as there is only one argument


or it is chain function when we call function as argument in other function  --  have doubt.
**********************************
============================================================

where we usec CData   --    no idea --  character data and when we want value inside the character data then we used --- but still why----

all datatypes are defined in dw::core
various native datatype -  array , Cdata , date , datetime , localtime , localdatetime , period, time , timezone
now()
today: now() as Date as String {format:"mm-dd"}   it is same as today: now() as String {format:"mm-dd"} 

upper bound type -   it is used when we have date time which is used in 10 places and we have to make changes at 10 places
inplace of this we can create 1 type function and make changes there and then we can use it everywhere.
eg - mydateformat= String {format:"mm-dd"}
today: now() as mydateformat

**************
need more info on "type" in dataview -------
***********

Defining namespace for xml - need more example and details about this , why we used it -------------------- need more
ns myns http://www.way2learnonline.com/mytypes

we can used with root xml value
{
myns#users:
{}}


this is xml wehre they have namespace = <way2learn:products xmlns:way2learn="http">

in dw it is same as = 
do{ ns way2learn http
---
{way2learn#products:{
product @(productid :"1"):{



na,espace is mostly belongs to root tag ----  need to confirm 
============================================================


what is dataview selectors - -----  types of selectors
single value selector  = .keyname
multivalue selector  = .*keyname
descendant selector = ..keyname
indexed selector = [keyname]
key value pair selector = .&keyname
range selector = [index to index]
xml attribute selctor = @,.@keyname
key/xml attribute present selector = keyname? , keyname.@type?
filter selectors = [?(boolean expression)]

<way2learn:products xmlns:way2learn="http">
 <product productid="1">

do{ ns way2learn http                - do{, it is there while converting xml to Dw
---
{way2learn#products:{
product @(productid :"1"):{


we can also read any file which is there in resource instead of creating metadata with it =
how to do it = var productsxml= readUrl("classpath://examples/products.xml","application/xml")
---
productsxml   -  we can see the whole file in output/preview


***********************************************************************************************
var productsxml= readUrl("classpath://examples/products.xml","application/xml")
var products= productxml.products.*product
fun getallproductname()= products.name

---
getallproductname()                --- all the function /variable declare above"---" is global in nature so ...any function can use ,
 scope  of the variable is for whole transformation

...in given function if want to use any variable we dont have to define this in function as argument .

if we want use local variable/private varible which has use scope only for that function only.
ex - 
var productsxml= readUrl("classpath://examples/products.xml","application/xml")
fun getallproductname()=
do{
var products= productxml.products.*product
---
products.name
}
---
getallproductname()


another ex - 

fun getallproductname(filename:String)=
do{
var productsxml= readUrl(filename,"application/xml")
var products= productxml.products.*product
---
products.name
}
---
getallproductname("classpath://examples/products.xml")
**************************************************************

productsXml.product.#  -  it give the namespace 
# - represent namespace object    ,  namespace  - is datatype in dataview

var productsxml= readUrl("classpath://examples/products.xml","application/xml")
var products= productxml.products.*product
var myns= productsXml.product.#.url
---
myns#products:{(products)}  -  it is sysntax to apply namespace is #  -  this how we can apply namespace to xml

myns#products:{                - it is for selecting value for arguments with namespace
ids:products.@productid}


productxml.products.*product.*productsid  -- same as = products.*productsid


productxml..   -  descendant selector
sizeof(productsXml..) -- give the total number of key-value pair in descendant form

another example --------
var productsxml= readUrl("classpath://examples/products.xml","application/xml")
var products= productxml.products.*product
var myns= productsXml.product.#.url

var obj={firstname:"raj",lastname:"tor"}
---
user:{}
user:obj.firstname
user:obj.&firstname   -  it is key value selector
productsxml.products
productsxml.&products


products.name?  -   ? is the operator which check the existance of the expression. , $  is operator pointing at current value
products[?($.brandname=="hp")]   -   syntax for filter ...condition met then need output apply then it is very useful

======================================================================================









====================================================================================

what is while coverting all the key to upper we dont need product as it is extra field added just so we can call array as function
ex - covertkeyupper(product:{(products)})   --   how can we not have extra product but meet the requirement.


===============================

recursion - function calling itself is called as recursion.
tail recursion --  explained in dataview udemy course

=================================

reduce function in mule is based on tail recursion

===================================

how to make array of data in simple data in dataview

also when we use dw:: arrays
ex :  Arrays::every (products , product) -> product.originalprice <=5000    - it will give us value less than 5000 but how can i get filed name also with it
also output we get is in array , what if i want that data in simple form.......


log function  when we used we can see the logs in console , how we can see this in as output in postman or store in any file.----

in transform output part - it is alwayd poiny to output payload but we can also create variable through it -- where we use them or hoe it work----
also we can create attributes -- where we use and how we use------------need example atleast--------------
main doubt id..we create varible and when we call the endpoint does it also work with the payload that we transform ---


when we transorm data from sxm/json to csv,xlsx  -  how it done means what will be the data styructure like------------

can we do xml to csv --

also when we covert xlsx file to xml ---  while creating metadata do we have to create field manually as per in xlsx sheet or we can have it loaded 
directly...   doubt occure because od   , video no = 57  n by chinna mule 4x.


what is inbound and outbound http request---
